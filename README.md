# The Cofty Programming Language
This is the main source code repository for Cofty. It contains the compiler, standard library, and documentation.

Code written in this language is compiled in [Rust]. A smart compiler makes it possible to write less code with the same efficiency of its execution as if you were writing it in [Rust].
