# The Cofty Programming Language
This is the main source code repository for Cofty. It contains the compiler, standard library, and documentation.

A smart compiler makes it possible to write less code with the same efficiency and safy of its execution as if you were writing it in [Rust].

[Rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org

# Installing
`gcc` and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) first.

# Syntax example
- Future Cofty
```Python
print('Hello World!')
```
- Current Cofty
```cpp
printf('Hello World!')
```
- Rust
```Rust
fn main() {
  println("Hello World!");
}
```
- C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
