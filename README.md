# The Cofty Programming Language
This is the main source code repository for Cofty. It contains the compiler, standard library, and documentation.

<!--A smart compiler makes it possible to write less code with the same efficiency and safy of its execution as if you were writing it by [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).-->
